<h1>CIS 320 Systems Design</h1>

<h3> We utlized an Agile Methodology with 3 Showcased Iterations </h3>

<h2> Iteration 1</h2>
<b>
- System Request: Provide a one page summary of the information system
opportunity. Address the elements shown in the SAD text,
following that format. <br/> 
- Narrative: This section of the report is a detailed description that
expands on elements of the system request. Includes problem statement, business case, and feasiblity considerations <br/>
- Process Models: This section of the report elaborates on the problem
statement by describing the current business process(es)
and the envisioned business process(es) using UML diagrams <br/> 
- Vision Document: Provides the scope of the project including system features, system requirements, and product features <br/>
- Agile Stories: Write four Agile stories for the client using the format that
instructor will provide. Identify each story with an ID. <br/>
</b>

<h2> Iteration 2</h2>
<b>
- Vision Document: Provides the scope of the project including system features, system requirements, and Appendex A <br/> 
- System Requirements: From the high-level requirements (i.e., Product Features
section of the Vision Document), construct a complete set of
system requirements, organized as a hierarchy <br/>
- List of Use Cases: From the system requirements and product features (Vision
Document), identify the use cases. The use cases should be
constructed as overview, essential use cases <br/> 
- Inital Architecture Considerations: Provide descriptions and representations of system
architecture options from (1) the design viewpoint; and (2) the
realization viewpoint. <br/>
- Risk Analysis: Define the criteria for assessing use case risk
• Assign a risk level, either “high” or “low” to each use case
Second, describe all other risk areas:
• Define the criteria for assessing risk
• Assign a risk level, either “high” or “low” to each risk
item
Third, describe how risk may be addressed during the
iterations of the Elaboration phase. <br/>
- Gantt Chart: Provide Gantt charts showing project tasks for two periods:
• I2: Date 1 to Date 2 (dates from Syllabus Schedule)
• I3: Date 3 to Date 4 (dates from Syllabus Schedule)
Gantt charts should identify:
• Task ID number and name
• Task start date and duration
• Task responsibility (individual team member level)
• Task dependencies <br/>
- Inception Phase: Create a high-level prototype (HTML or similar screen
mockups) that represents the data needs and process flows of
the “To-be” business process. Concentrate on high risk use
cases. The prototype may not connect to databases or use
anything other than the minimum of programming. <br/>
</b>

<h2> Iteration 5</h2>
<b>
- Class Diagram: Generate a class diagram for all
problem domain classes. Add classes for use cases not
covered in Assignment #3. Include data attributes, operations,
and associations among classes. Use the guidelines in the
SAD text in formatting the class diagram.
Explain the class diagram in terms the client would
understand <br/> 
- Database Diagram: Create the data storage classes (tables) for a relational
database management system deployment. Design the
database in 3NF. Also, provide data descriptions (data types and sizes) for the
attributes of each table. <br/> 
- UI Navigation Diagram & Screen Layouts: Provide screen layouts for input screens/forms (data capture)
and output screens/reports (data presentation). Layouts may
be borrowed from the HTML prototype (recommended) or
presented in storyboard form. Explain how the screen layouts
realize the use cases. <br/>
- Gantt Chart: Provide Gantt chart(s) showing project tasks for two periods:
• Iteration 3
• Iteration 5 and Elaboration Spec
Gantt chart(s) should identify:
• Task ID number and name
• Task start date and duration
• Task responsibility (individual team member level)
• Task dependencies <br/> 
- User Interface Prototypes: Create a high-level prototype (HTML or similar screen
mockups) that represents the data needs and process flows of
all use cases. The prototype may not connect to databases or
use anything other than the minimum of programming <br/>
